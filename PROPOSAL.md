Title: Analysis of Heart Disease Data to Predict Likelihood of Disease in an Individual. 

Introduction: Heart disease is the second most common cause of death in Canada. Coronary artery disease is one of  the most prevalent kind of heart disease and can result in a heart attack. It has been proven that lifestyle modifications and, in certain situations, medication, can significantly lower your chance for developing heart disease. In this analysis we will aim to answer the question: what factors can help us predict whether an individual will have heart disease? To answer this question we will be using a heart disease dataset that has information on 303 patients with 14 columns containing data about different medical information. The class we want to predict is wether or not heart disease is present in an individual based on evaluating three predictors: cholestrol levels, blood sugar levels and age, which are all known factors that effect the probability of a patient being diagnosed with heart disease.
